APT Landing page
========================

Small landing page for my apartment. Serves as a Resume for me and a dashboard for my server. This is an attempt to learn React. I have alot of experience with Angular 1 but this is brand new to me. It will most likely not follow all the best practice conventions. 

Written with Node, React, Flask, and one branch uses Socket.io(Both Python and js).
Python requirements are all within requirements.txt and fufillible with `pip -r`. Node req are all included in `packages.json`. It might contain a few extra as well. Writeup to come when I am "finished."
